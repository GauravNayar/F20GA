Loading the models:
There were several issues with loading the models into the template code. The first of which was even before starting work on the interaction section for OpenGL. The default template code is supposed to run the program to render a dog model from the assets folder. However, the dog was rendering with texture issues with only the colour and haphazard textures being rendered. An undue amount of time was spent in trying to figure out the issue. Most students could run the default template code with no issues, which meant that the problem was in my system. The main difference that I spotted was that the Renderer in other sytems was either Intel's integrated graphics or Nvidea graphics driver. The template code however, was using the APU
'AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics' as the renderer in my system. I manually updated the AMD graphics driver, however it did not solve the issue. I then had to manually switch the renderer to use my dedicated Nvidea graphics card for OpenGL from the Nvidea control panel. This forced the template to switch to the Nvidea graphics driver which solved the issue.
The template uses .gltf files to load in the object models. In order to load in the models successfully, the models had to be exported from blender in .gltf format with bin and texture image files. Several attempts to load in the models were unsuccessful with the models breaking in the OpenGL application. To solve this issue, the models were properly unwrapped using 'lightmap pack' unwrap option in blender. This uv map was saved as a new image with a 4k resolution. Inside the shading section of blender, for every material of every model, an image texture node was added with the uv map image assigned to it. After selecting the model, and the uv map image texture node, the bake function was used inside Blender's rendering options. The bake functionionality of blender enables different texture images to be blended into a single texture image. All of the materials were deleted and only a single texture image node was used for the models. After baking a single texture image, the models were then able to be successfully exported as separate .gltf, bin and texture image files. Inside the template, the LoadGltf function was used by providing the directory of the model's .gltf file.

Interaction: 
The application is interactive with the users being able to navigate the scene using an exploratory camera. Users' can use the keyboard keys 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' to navigate the exploratory camera in the directions of 'front','left','back', and 'right' respectively. Additionally, users' can rotate the scene model using the 'left' and 'right' directional keys of the keyboard to rotate the model left or right respectively. The y-axis value of the model rotation variable was updated to change the rate of the model's rotation. Similarly, the camera navigation was implemented by updating the camera position values in the 'update()' function of the main loop in the source file.
